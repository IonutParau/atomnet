# For initial release

- CRITICAL: make OSP have a global limit and globally applicable congestion control and not per-connection!
It seems we're running into issues with modem call budgets not latency

- rfs, remote filesystem, ftp-like stuff
- anpm, oppm-like package managet built with AtomNET and AWP
- atomtui, a TUI version of atomcli, likely with less features and more confused on setting up config
- WiFi-like stuff
